# Netflix For Data Analysis using Python and Sql server 

Netflix Data Analysis and Recommendation System
# This project involves analyzing Netflix data and developing a recommendation system using Python. The main objectives are to explore trends in Netflix content, build a recommendation engine, and create an interactive dashboard for dynamic data exploration.

# Key Features:
Data Collection and Preparation:

Collected and cleaned data from Netflixâ€™s public datasets.
Preprocessed data for analysis, including handling missing values and normalizing formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Performed data visualization to uncover trends and patterns such as genre distribution and popularity over time.
Used libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating insightful charts and graphs.
Recommendation System:

Implemented collaborative filtering to recommend content based on user preferences.
Developed a content-based recommendation engine using movie/show attributes like genres and actors.
Predictive Modeling:

Built predictive models to estimate ratings and viewer engagement.
Evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE and accuracy.
Interactive Dashboard:

Created an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash or Streamlit for users to explore data insights dynamically.
Incorporated features such as search functionality, filters, and dynamic visualizations.
Technologies Used:
* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
